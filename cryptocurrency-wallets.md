				<h4>A happy user is an active user</h4>

				<p>
					Whether you’re regulated as a money transmitter or just want to protect your reputation by being proactive about knowing your customers, identity verification is a huge challenge for cryptocurrency wallet providers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Forums are full of tirades from users unable to sign up to their wallet of choice because they didn’t have the right identity documents, from those frustrated with the hoops they had to jump through to prove their identity and from users locked ou of their accounts for days at a time.
				</p>

				<h5>What if your wallet eliminated these frustrations? What if you could...</h5>

				<p>
					<ul class="no-bullets">
						<li>
							&bullet; &nbsp; &nbsp;Safely grow your userbase in regions with a large unbanked or underbanked population?
						</li>
						<li>
							&bullet; &nbsp; &nbsp; Attract more users by improving the security of your wallet without affecting their experience?
						</li>
						<li>
							&bullet; &nbsp; &nbsp; Retain users by offering a slick account reactivation experience?
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h5>Onboard more users and protect your reputation with social KYC</h5>
				<p>Do you really need to see an official identity document for a user just to sign up to your wallet, or to carry out a low value transaction? Then answer is no.</p>
				<p>Our social Know Your Customer (KYC) solution verifies a user’s identity in real-time. It’s quick, frictionless and mobile-friendly too, and can be used when onboarding and/or at the point of transaction.</p>

				<h5>Reactivate accounts more quickly</h5>

				<p>Nothing is more frustrating for a user than being locked out of their account for days while their identity is being verified because they’ve lost their login credentials.</p>
				<p>When a user is locked out of their account, give them the option of proving they are who they say they are with a variety of identity verification challenges, that can be completed on a mobile, for faster account reactivation.</p>

				<h5>A User’s Story</h5>

				<em>
					<p>“I tried to set up a Bitcoin wallet as a friend told me it was a quick, easy and cheap way to transfer money to anyone, anywhere in the world.</p>
					<p>Turns out it wasn’t so easy… They wanted my ID documents, which I didn’t have with me at the time. When I was able to share them I thought that would be that. It wasn’t - they needed to approve my account. That could take 48 hours. It might be cheap, but it certainly wasn’t quick and easy.”</p>
				</em>

				<h5>What our customers say…</h5>

					<em>“We especially like the frictionless user experience. If you have a consumer facing mobile app and need to integrate ID services I highly recommend checking out Veridu.”</em>
