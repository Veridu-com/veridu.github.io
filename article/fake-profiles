					“It’s so easy to set up a fake Facebook/LinkedIn/Twitter profile!”. We hear that a lot and we can’t disagree. It is easy to create a fake social media account. But… how easy (and how long would it take) to set up fake accounts on multiple platforms that look both real and consistent?
				</p>
				
				<p>
          Think about it. How long would it take to create profiles on several social media platforms that shared some level of consistency, and not just in the personal information the user provides (name, date of birth, address etc.)? How easy would it be to find real friends and connections for these fake accounts? And then how easy would it be to have them interact with your fake accounts in a normal way - commenting on posts, tagging photos, checking into restaurants and bars with ‘you’, wishing ‘you’ a happy birthday? And what about generating history? Social media has been around for over a decade and many of us have built up deep histories (see the article we recommend about downloading your own Facebook history). How will the fake ‘you’ quickly and convincingly build up a realistic looking past?
        </p>
        
        <p>
          “What about the data breaches social media sites have suffered? It’s so easy for people to buy a fake profile!”. We hear that a lot too. But again, it’s not as simple as simply buying a fake profile from the dark web. When we talk about digital identity we’re referring to the whole life we live online - not one social media account taken in isolation.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          So, we’ve established that it’s tough to craft a convincing digital footprint, but cyber-criminals will always try to beat the system, and they’ll carry on trying to defraud companies using fake identities. As a result, you need a robust means of detecting and preventing this kind of activity.
        </p>
        
				<h5>What’s wrong with a passport?</h5>
        
        <p>
          “If I need to check someone’s identity, I’ll just ask to see their passport”. That’s not something we hear a lot. Why? Because the companies we deal with want to onboard their customers quickly, whilst giving them a frictionless digital experience. Fitting a paper-based identity verification step into a purely online transaction just doesn’t work. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, the companies we deal with want to grow globally, often into segments of the population that have been excluded from the mainstream financial system. These people may not have paper documents, but they do have mobiles and they do engage in social media. That’s why we’re seeing such tremendous interest in the use of social media for identity verification - we call it ‘Social KYC’.

        <h5>What’s the score with Social KYC?</h5>
        
        <p>
          In the same way that you would verify the validity of a paper identity document, you need to have the means to assess the credibility of a digital footprint. The good news is that unlike many of the tools used for paper identity documents, the tools used to analyse digital footprints are fast, robust and accurate. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Advanced technology, artificial intelligence and machine learning means we can now analyse vast quantities of unstructured data instantly, and with high-levels of confidence. Specifically, for digital identity, this means that data from multiple accounts can be cross-referenced, corroborated and structured into meaningful facts, which can be assigned confidence scores and used to verify and authenticate a person’s identity.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          While the concept is relatively new, Social KYC is a reality, and as the push for financial inclusion continues digital identities will play a central role.
