					Members are a demanding bunch

					checks to keep them safe, but they
					also expect instant access to your
					platform.
				</p>
				<p>
					Until now this meant balancing levels
					of risk and reward, but what if you
					didn’t have to compromise?

					It’s easy for members too - all they
					need to do is log in to their online
					accounts. We then analyse their
					digital footprint, assess how long it
					would take to fake, and give them
					an overall credibility score.
				</p>

				<h5>Don't be a stranger</h5>
				<p>
					Your online footprint contains a
					wealth of information about you.
					Your check-ins, likes, posts and
					comments paint a clear picture of
					you as an individual.
				</p>
				<p>
					Veridu provides you with valuable
					insight into your members. Spot
					your frequent travellers from your
					students and let users share their
					Veridu profiles with other members
					to become acquainted before they
					meet or transact.
				</p>
				<h5>Keep it real</h5>
				<p>
					Keep your users safer by eliminating fake accounts and ensuring every member of your platform is traceable in the event that a complaint against them is made.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our social ID checks authenticate user provided contact information. We dig deep into a user’s digital footprint to corroborate these details, including establishing their location based on actual online activity. Once verified members get a visible badge to showcase their trustworthiness.

				<h5>A User’s Story</h5>

				<em>
					<q cite="user">
						<span>
							I recently decided to rent out my
							flat while I was on holiday to earn
							some extra cash. I’d thought about
							it for ages but letting a complete
							stranger into my home just didn’t
							feel right.
						</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						<span>
							When I got my first enquiry I
							almost pulled out. What changed
							my mind? The service I was using
							sent me a great profile of my
							potential guest. It was based
							on their social media profiles
							and contained all the usual
							information, and then some. Like
							the fact they were an avid traveller
							just like me. This little fact made
							me a whole lot more comfortable
							and I gave me the confidence I
							needed to accept their booking
