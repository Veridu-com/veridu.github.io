					Supporting your e-Commerce customers is getting more complex - because their customer base is getting more complex. They’re global, they want to browse and buy anywhere and anytime; they want to pay using different methods, from credit card to eWallets; and they won’t tolerate a bad user experience. And that’s just the legitimate customers. Don’t forget about the increasingly sophisticated fraudsters who are stealing and faking identities with greater ease.

					Your customers need to find the right balance between building their global businesses and mitigating fraud. As their payments partner they’ll turn to you for support, but can you currently provide them with exactly what they need?

				<h5>What if you used Veridu?</h5>

				<p>Veridu brings trust to the internet with consent-driven social media identity solutions. Our solutions can be integrated into your payment platform and fraud management solution to help your customers increase their profits, decrease fraud and maintain low chargeback rates.</p>

				<h5>
					Why Veridu? <br>
					Keep  the fraudsters out, let the customers in
				</h5>
				<p>
					Personally Identifiable Information (PII), credit card details, traditional identity documents - they’re all easy for fraudsters to steal or fake. Faking a convincing online life, on the other hand, is tough and takes a lot of time.
				</p>
				<p>
					By analysing an individual’s online footprint, in real time, Veridu can assess their credibility with confidence. When integrated into your fraud prevention engine this capability safely reduces false positives allowing your merchants to sell more

				<h5>Be m-Commerce friendly</h5>
				<p>
					Payment and identity authentication solutions are still playing catch up when it comes to m-Commerce. Conversion rates are suffering because users choose to abandon purchases rather than jump through hoops.
				</p>
				<p>
					Veridu’s social identity checks simply ask a user to login to existing social and online accounts (that they’re already likely to be logged into on their device). A better experience will boost conversions for your merchants while still keeping fraud to a minimum.

				<h5>Frictionless identity and age verification</h5>
				<p>
					You know that asking a customer to provide traditional proof of identity or age at the point of purchase is highly likely to result in abandonment, so why do it?
				</p>
				<p>
					Veridu can verify a user’s identity and age using their social and online accounts. It’s real-time, frictionless and mobile-friendly too, so you can protect yourself and still make the sale.

				<h5>A User’s Story</h5>

				<em>
					<q cite="user">
						<span>
							I got my first bonus at work yesterday and decided to treat myself to a brand new TV - it’s the most extravagant thing I’ve ever bought myself. I went to a site that a friend recommended and found what I wanted for a great price, and next day delivery - easy! Turns out it wasn’t because my payment was declined.
						</span>
						<br>
						<span>
							I thought about calling my bank to sort it out, but knowing how long that would take I tried another online retailer just to see what would happen. They accepted my payment straight away. Guess who I’ll be recommending to my friends?
						</span>
					</q>
